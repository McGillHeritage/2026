## About the Newsletters
The McGill Newsletters/Keith's Corner issues were first published in 2019. Each week author and long-time McGill resident, Keith Gibson, publishes a newsletter. Born and raised in McGill, Keith's writing offers a unique and personal insight into the town's rich history. McGill was a company-owned town in the day, with the Kennecott Copper Company being the major employer of McGill residents, including Keith's parents. Keith is also a volunteer at the historic McGill Pharmacy and Drug Store and conducts tours of the buisness. His efforts to preserve the history of this small mining town will serve many generations to come.

This collection will house the newsletters, beginning with 2019 through the present. This site houses the 2025 newsletters.
